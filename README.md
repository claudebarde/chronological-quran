# chronological-quran

A simple Node.js website that allows its users to read the Quran in the Revelation order.

The website integrates as well a package I am testing (quranJS) to display Quranic verses and search for words in Quran.

Quran text and information come from http://tanzil.net and include the following copyright notice :
